Welcome to a fun world of jokes and surprises behind every click.
The theme for this website is simply to have a laugh at some cheesy dad jokes and and appreciate a good pun!
Each member was given free reigh over their page. We chose a color pallete that was bright and high constrast to keep 
the mood high. The only goal of the website was to have some fun with it and maybe make someone chuckle.
I'd even take a loud quick breath released out the nose in appreciation of a good cliche joke. 
The homepage is a quick introduction of everyone in the team, and a fun made-up fact about us each that could probably be true. 
The hero section pulls from the Joke API, receiving a set up and punchline from a random generated joke from the API array. 
There are interactive navigation links and github buttons that link directly to each of our github pages.
Page two has an interactive form that allows you to search through the Joke API using a keyword instead of generating a random joke as it does in the hero section. 
Page three has a classic meme image, a fun secret button with a message from a spam risk near you. 
Page four uses the Meme API. It fetches random meme images and displays after the user enters a word into the input container and hits the enter button. A new meme displays each time the button is pressed. The function clears each image before the new image is displayed. 

Each interactive button has animation that starts as an X and spirals away when the mouse hovers over it. 

Flex box was utilized through out each page to style with animations for most of the buttons. 

I hope this site makes you smile and you have a great day!
